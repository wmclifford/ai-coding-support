## Goal

Construct a high-level plan for the outstanding items of this project:

- CI workflows
- Project templates according to implementation language
- Helper/support tools (implemented in separate repositories)
- Documentation

## Background

- Essential scaffolding for this project (governing documents, prompts, instructions, templates, etc.) is in place.
- There are some broad goals already outlined in the project's README; we need to flesh them out more.
- Once we have identified the "components" of the project (as mentioned in our session goal), we need to identify
  the first two or three "milestones" for each component according to their priority.
- Project templates that will be provided by this project are to be organized according to the implementation
  language. The types of projects for each language still need to be defined and should be part of this discussion.

## Constraints

- "Milestones" are expected to be relatively broad goals, not specific tasks.
- Each milestone should be clearly defined so that we can construct a detailed plan in later sessions where
  individual tasks are created.
- Each milestone will be implemented using an AI agent and so must be easily understood by both the agent and the
  developer.

## Deliverables

- A human-friendly plan for the project components and their milestones in `PLAN.md`.
- A machine-friendly plan for the project components and their milestones in `.ai/plan.yaml`.

## Success Criteria

- Clearly identifies each component in the project and its purpose.
- Clearly identifies each milestone in each component.

## Notes

- Remember to review the governing documents for the project before starting the planning process.
- A lot of the details of the project are still in the "idea" stage; we may need to run a few iterations to nail
  down specifics to have what we need to define the components and milestones.
