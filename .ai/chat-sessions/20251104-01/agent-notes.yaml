start_time: "2025-11-04T00:00:00Z"
summary: |
  Started vibe planning session to draft a high-level plan for the `ai-coding-support` meta-repo.
  Focus areas: CI workflows, project templates, helper tools, and documentation.
notes:
  - reviewed: README.md, docs/Vibe-Planning.md, docs/three-pass-plan.md
  - created: PLAN.md, .ai/plan.yaml (initial drafts)
  - user_preferences_received: |
      1) Language priority: Node.js, Go, Python, Java. Prioritize Node.js and Go to build helper tools. Use copy/paste for Java projects for now.
      2) Use cases priority: CLI first, libraries second, web services third.
      3) CI provider: GitHub Actions only; mandatory PR checks: lint, schema validation, gitleaks. Medium: commit message format, license checks.
      4) Helper tools: each tool in its own repo; prefer Node.js and Go; prepare each repo for packaging/publishing and include `setup-*` Actions.
      5) Publishing from this meta-repo: none for now; discuss per-template when appropriate.
decisions:
  - initial_plan_created: true
open_questions:
  - id: publishing-automation
    note: "When to include publishing automation for templates (defer to per-template planning)."
next_actions:
  - review PLAN.md and .ai/plan.yaml with user and iterate
  - convert agreed milestones to Tasks/*.yaml and run 3-pass workflow

  nodejs:
    linters: "ESLint + Prettier are commonly recommended: Prettier for formatting, ESLint for code-quality rules."
    cli_libs: "Yargs and Commander are the most common; Yargs is a good default for declarative parsing."

  go:
    linters: "golangci-lint is widely recommended as an aggregator (wraps staticcheck, govet, etc.)."
    cli_libs: "Cobra is the most used for feature-rich CLIs; urfave/cli is a lighter alternative."

  python:
    linters: "Flake8 is common (user preference); Ruff is an increasingly popular, faster alternative; Black for formatting."
    cli_libs: "Click is widely used and confirmed by the user; Typer and argparse are alternatives depending on needs."

  - I will append a new YAML document to this file after each substantive session update as requested.
  - No `Tasks/*.yaml` created in this session; task creation will be performed in later sessions per your instruction.
