  Node.js CLI tool: create template "System.md" governing document.
status: pending
rationale: |
  - Provide a template "System.md" that the user must complete as part of bootstrapping a new Node.js CLI tool project.
  - The template should be a Markdown document containing the basic sections required to define the system-level instructions followed in the project.
  - The template should provide as much common information as possible to reduce the amount of boilerplate required to get started.

notes: |
  - An example of a completed "System.md" for a Java project is located at `examples/governance/System.md`;
    this may be used as an example and adapted to fit the needs of a Node.js CLI tool project.
  - The `docs/governance/System.md` for this project may also be used as an example, although this project does
    not have any coding tasks, just documentation.
  - Include at least the following sections:
      - "Security"
      - "Dependencies"
      - "Observability, Monitoring, and Logging"
      - "Performance"
      - "API Surface"
      - "CI/CD"
      - "Branch & Merge Policy"
      - "Evidence & Audit"
      - "Data"
      - "Releases & Publishing"
      - "Secrets & Credentials"
      - "Deviations & ADRs"
    Others may be added where appropriate.
  - Remember that this is a template; the specifics of the CLI tool that would be built are unknown at this time.
    However, the system-level instructions should be relatively consistent across all projects of this type.
